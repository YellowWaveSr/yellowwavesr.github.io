						<h3><b>R1--Speech enhancement based on deep learning and beamforming</b></h3>
						<p> 
						My interest in Digital Signal Processing started when I was an undergraduate student. While studying in Shanghai Jiao
						Tong University, I registered for a handful of courses concentrating on DSP techniques. These courses not only helped me
						understand the basics of DSP algorithms, but also provided me a chance to see a lot of exciting and edge-cutting DSP
						theories and applications. Realizing that DSP techniques are important in both the industry and our daily life, I
						selected my capstone project focusing on speech enhancement for multiple channel inputs. In this project, I applied both
						statistical machine learning methods (Expectation Maximization) and deep learning methods (LSTM) for audio signal mask
						estimation. To better adapt real-world application scenarios, I also implemented the source separation algorithm for
						multi-channel microphone arrays. Eventually, I deployed my algorithms on a Samsung mobile phone with 3 microphones, and
						I was rejoiced when I saw my codes worked well during the tests.

						<h3><b>R2--Music beat extraction for symbolic music based on language model </b></h3>
						<p> 
						Aiming at developing better DSP algorithms and creating meaningful DSP applications, I joined Music X Lab as a research
						assistant after obtaining my Bachelor’s degree. In the Music X Lab, I realized that it is both meaningful and
						challenging to have machines understand music recordings. Consequently, I selected music beat analysis as my research
						topic. To complete this project, I familiarized myself with symbolic music and language models. Also, I completed beat
						tracking tasks and modified MuseBERT for music beat estimation. These proposed methods allowed computers to
						intelligently understand music recordings based on music beats.

						<h3><b>R3--Speech enhancement internship based on microphone design and transfer learning</b></h3>
						<p> 
						Although the music processing project turned out to be a success, the more I worked, the more I found myself lacking
						theoretical and practical knowledge, especially given the fact that DSP techniques are revolutionized everyday with
						modern deep learning methods. Therefore, I decided to join Georgia Tech and study towards a master’s degree. To explore
						more about DSP and music analysis, I joined the Music Informatics Lab and continued my research in relevant fields.
						During my first year of my master’s study, I developed a deep learning model that could automatically rank music
						performances and give performance scores. This project again made an important contribution to music understanding with
						computers. To catch up with the up-to-date industrial developments, I completed two internships in the area of signal
						processing and music processing. In 2023, I joined shure.inc, where I applied speech enhancement (beam-forming and deep
						learning) in microphone systems for professional recording facilities. Plus, I also learned about sound simulation and
						microphone design.

						<h3><b>R4--Music video understanding based on language model</b></h3>
						<p>
						In 2024, I completed another internship at clearmotion.inc, where I created an in-vehicle
						infotainment system that can automatically perform vehicle chassis movements according to videos played on the phone.
						This internship experience allowed me to  explore more on multi-model systems in information retrieval.  To begin with,
						I built up an event detection system to capture interesting scenes from the audio-visual signals. Moreover, I applied
						the beat tracking algorithm to analyze the background music in the video. Finally, I combined these information sources
						such that the chairs in the vehicle could move and shake properly when the passengers were watching videos. This
						internship helped me establish a better understanding of multimedia signals, and the deployment of the system to a real
						vehicle has greatly improved my programming skills. Although this internship is already completed, I’m still working
						with my manager to apply for a patent for my infotainment system.

						<h3><b>R5--Speech synthsize based on tone extraction</b></h3>
						<p>
						Most recently, I got a chance to connect with Georgia Tech professors working on healthcares using advanced signal
						processing and machine learning techniques. Inspired by them, I started to understand how DSP methods could contribute
						to human health, which is of great significance for the quality of life and social welfare. Last semester, I worked on
						voice conversion for the patients with vocal cord diseases during the therapy stage. I extracted the short syllables
						which are good in quality and extracted the tone of those moments to synthesize a better speech for the patient.

						<h3><b>R6--Obstructive Sleep Apnea diagnosis based on 3D rendering</b></h3>

						<p> 
							
						This semester, I am working on a 3D reconstruction for the human airway before surgery based on CT scans and 2D photos. I
						think only the combination of the embeddings for reconstruction and metadata might be of help in diagnosis, which is
						verified during the experiments. While doing these two projects, I realized how modern technologies could help people
						and lead us to a better life. I believe this is the ultimate goal of technology development, and I wish I could continue
						doing this in the future.
