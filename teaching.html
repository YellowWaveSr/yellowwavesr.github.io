				<h3><b>T1--Chinese and Western Music Theory and the applications</b></h3>
				<p>
					This is one of the humanity requirement courses for undergraduates in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
					<br>
					I grade the assignments and final exam for the students.
					<br>
					I gave a guest lecture on the trend of AI music generation.
					<br>
					I wrote a chapter for the new textbook for AI music generation(In Chinese), which covers the most traditional
					rule-based music generation to statistic machine learning models like HMM, till deep neural networks, language
					models, and the popular Large Language Models. In addition to the introductions, I designed the exercises for
					undergraduate students major in Engeering to try the python scripts to generate their own musics.
				</p>

			<div class="box" id="t2">
				<h3><b>T2--Sight-singing and ear-training</b></h3>
				<p>
					This is a class for Minor degree in Music for undergraduate students in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
					<br>
					I have perfect pitch myself, but I always use the relative relationship to help the students to understand music.
					<br>
					I designed a couple of listening tests to make the students tell apart the "color" of music.
					<br>
					I applied Curwen hand signs to help students sing the scales accurately.

			<div class="box" id="t3">
				<h3><b>T3--Conductor for adult ameteurs</b></h3>
				<p>
					I was the conductor to make 24 untrained people perform a 4-part chorus work in two weeks.
					<br>
					I designed a couple of voice training games to keep them interested and understand the principals.
					<br>
					I encouraged them to sing out loud in front of the groups and arrange them in the balanced structure.
					<br>
					I led the groups get the first prize in their community competition.
					
				</p>

			<div class="box" id="t4">
				<h3><b>T4--Tutor in High School Physics and Maths</b></h3>
				<p>
					I worked as a private tutor for a few high school students.
					<br>
					For each class I prepare a couple of basic questions, and then followup step by step.
					<br>
					I like to design real-world related applications for my students to search for open-ended answers.
					<br>
					I also focus on the foundations of my students, doing frequently quizs to check their learning.
